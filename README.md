# GameSandbox
Sandbox for making a game.

## Requirements
This repository can be run with Unity 2020.1.0b1. It is possible that it will not work with other version of Unity.

## Description
As of Nov 20, 2020 there is simply a cube with a green texture that oscillates between two points. The first point is the position that the cube starts in and the second point is given as a public value for the Cube object under the MyScript component. The duration of the oscillation can also be modified in the component.

## How To Use This Repository
Once you have a program that can interact with git (such as git bash), always check the status of your repository with `git status` before doing any action.

If you wish to update your local folder with the version on GitHub (remote) use
```
git pull
```

If you wish to add local changes to the remote version on GitHub, use
```
git add <ONLY_NECESSARY_FILES_SPACE_SEPARATED___THIS_CAN_BE_RUN_MULTIPLE_TIMES>
git commit -m "<MESSAGE_TEXT_HERE>"
git push
```

If you have local changes and there are remote changes, this process is more complicated - ask for help.
